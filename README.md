OCR = Optical Character Recognition. In other words, OCR systems transform a two-dimensional image of text, that could contain machine printed or handwritten text from its image representation into machine-readable text. OCR as a process generally consists of several sub-processes to perform as accurately as possible. The subprocesses are:

Preprocessing of the Image
Text Localization
Character Segmentation
Character Recognition
Post Processing
The sub-processes in the list above of course can differ, but these are roughly steps needed to approach automatic character recognition. In OCR software, itâ€™s main aim to identify and capture all the unique words using different languages from written text characters.
For almost two decades, optical character recognition systems have been widely used to provide automated text entry into computerized systems. Yet in all this time, conventional online OCR systems (like zonal OCR) have never overcome their inability to read more than a handful of type fonts and page formats. Proportionally spaced type (which includes virtually all typeset copy), laser printer fonts, and even many non-proportional typewriter fonts, have remained beyond the reach of these systems. And as a result, conventional OCR has never achieved more than a marginal impact on the total number of documents needing conversion into digital form.
